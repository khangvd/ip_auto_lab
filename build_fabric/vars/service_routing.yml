###################### Service: Routing Protocols ######################
# This supports creation of BGP peerings or non-backbone OSPF process
# All BGP updates allowed in/out is done using Route-maps and prefix-lists
# Redistribution of OSPF/BGP is done using Route-maps, prefix-lists and ExtCommunity lists
# Are 3 pre-built prefix-lists that can be referenced in OSPF or BGP: ALLOW-ALL, DENY-ALL, DEFAULT
# The OSPF process is built on a VPC pair of borders with a different area created for each pair. A new SVI is created for the RID and peering between them
# Only creates the OSPF process, interfaces are added using the 'Device ports' service.


# NEW INFO FOR THESE:
# Group/ template are OS specific but a grouping of settings to apply to all peers under that group
# timers, remote_as, allowed_in, alllowed_out, password,  switch, tenant, update_source, ebgp_multihop, next_hop_self can be done under the group/template or the peer. If both entered adds both but peer is more specific
# Always creates a RM, but will be let as bloank (permit all) if no allowed_in or alowed_out has been specified
# By default the group/template will use timers of 3 and 9 unless unhased and specified
# List of switches to create this on. Specifiy under the group if the switches are the same for all peers
# If allowed_in or allowed_out defined under the group/template uses that name in RM and PL, if defiend under peer uses that name in RM and PL
# If not defined in any created in group/template by default
# Mininmum that needs defineing is names (group and peer), tenant(under grp or peer), switch(under grp or peer), remote-as (under grp or peer), peer_ip (under peer)  and description (under peer)
# inbound and outbound hold all prefix manipulation and filtering
# If a peer or group inbound or outbound  is empty no route_map is created
# can have allowed_in, weigh_in and pref_in. Will form a RM in order deny wiegth, pref, allow. Exceptions are ALLOW and DENY which always at end.
# in the lists list the ACLs in order you want them to be sequenced in the prefix_list
# Cant have same name for muliple groups or peers as the RM and PL are created from name so wont be unique
# Can use a list of tnts, so that way the same peer can be used accross more than 1 tenant
# Anything that can have more than 1 value must be a list, even if it is a list wiht only 1 element
