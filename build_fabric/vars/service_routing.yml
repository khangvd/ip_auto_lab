###################### Service: Routing Protocols ######################
# Create BGP peerings, non-backbone OSPF processes and static routes
# Filtered and weighted redistribution is supported (connected, static, bgp, ospf) with the use of the metric
# Keywords 'any' and 'default' can be used rather than the list of prefixes with filtering and redistribution


#### BGP variables ####
# Use the group for global settings for all peers within that group, and peers for anything unique to that peer
# The majority of the settings can be configured under group or the peer. If set in the peer that will take precedence
# The exception to this are 'peer_ip' and 'description' which can only be set under the peer.
# By default the group will use timers of 3 and 9 unless unhased and specified in the group or peer

# Switch and tenant must be a list (even if is a single device). This is to allow for the same group and peers to be created on multiple devices
# A group does not need to have a switch defined, it will be automatically created on any switches that peers within it are created on

# The 'inbound' and 'outbound' dictionaries hold all prefix manipulation and filtering
# The name of the Route-maps and prefix-list incorporate the group or peer name dependant on where applied (no duplicate group or peer names allowed)
# 'as_path' and 'med' can be applied to outbound advertisements and 'weight' and local preference applied to those recieved inbound
# If everything is defined (allow, deny & BGP attributes) the order in the route-map is BGP_ATTR, deny_specific, allow_specific, allow_all, deny_all
# Inbound, outbound or redist prefixes must either be a list of prefixes or keywords 'any' or 'default'. Can use the keywords in place of the list of prefixes, however NOT within the list of prefixes
# Prefixes can include 'ge' and/or 'le' values in the dictionary element

# At a minimun the following settings need to be configured:
# group
# - name: string                Name of the group (used in group name and RM/PL names)
#   switch: list                List of switches to create group and peers on, could be specified in peer (still has to be list if is only 1)
#   tenant: list                List of tenants to create peers under, could be specified in peer (still has to be list if is only 1)
#   peer:                      List of all the BGP peers
#   - name: string              Name of the peer(used in RM/PL names)
#     remote_as: integrar       Remote AS of this peer
#     peer_ip: x.x.x.x          IP address of the peer
#     description: string       Description of the peer

# The switch can be defined under the process or interface, with intefrace taking precedence
# switch and interface are a list to allow for the same OSPF process and/or interface to be defined to multiple devices and/or interfaces
# Passive interface is enabled globally and disabled on all configured interfaces. This can be enabled on a per-interface basis
# By default area_type is normal, define 'area_type' to chnage to stub, stub no-summary, nssa, nssa no-summary, nssa default-information-originate or nssa no-redistribution.

# The summary prefix dict takes a list as a values, so only you only need lists of dicts if other dicts are differernt (swtches or filter)
# By default it is LSA5 summary, by adding an area makes it a LSA3 summary (summarise from that area). Use not_advertise with either to filter
