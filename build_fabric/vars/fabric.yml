# This Only scales to 4 spines, 10 leafs, 4 borders. By default the following ports are used:
# SPINE-to-LEAF = Eth1/1 - 1/10           SPINE-to-Border = Eth1/11 - 1/15
# LEAF-to-SPINE = Eth1/1 - 1/5            BORDER-to-SPINE: = Eth1/1 - 1/5
# MLAG Peer-link = Eth1/127 - 128          MLAG keepalive = mgmt

# How big the network is, so the number of each switch. border/leaf must be in increments of 2 as in MLAG pair
