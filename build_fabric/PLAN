==== VALDIATE ====
2. Add validation checks
-Validate input data is correct (addresses valid, follows naming formats, intergrars, etc), based on my compliance requirements
-Output is expected, compared to what expect from the input file
-Validate LLDP to check cabling correct, BGP peerings, what else???

AT this point halfway through, evaluate as next need to add services
