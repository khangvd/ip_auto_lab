I change ec_fmt in fabric.yml from Port-channel to port-channel, need to keep inmind incase thigns start failing


INTERFACES: need to be able to create loopbacks - JUST NEED TO INCLUDE IF IN DEFAULT VRF

Loopback must be /32
reserved range is 11 to 20
If not teannt set for any needs to be put in default


TRY -> on nexus, should be waht using for redist

+POST_VAL to fix=
post-val for new loopback interface variabel setup (bse)
New lp_fmt to be tested for
Make surw that interface ranges dont conflict with fbric LOOPBACKS OR interfaces
itnerface tenant can be nothing and then is default
interfaces in service interface are now a list
loopback ip must be /32

RTR post-val
no duplicate group or peer names
cant have same prefix in a prefix-list (duplicate preofx in same prefix-list)
BGP tenant has to be s single device, or a list of multiple devices (cant be muliple devices not in a list)
(no duplicate group or peer names allowed)
 'as_path' and 'med' can be applied to outbound advertisements and 'weight' and local preference applied to those recieved inbound
prefix always must be a list,even if only 1 element.
BGP deny does not accept the default  keywork, all others do
Cant have host address (/32) on a normal intefrcaes
OSPF  interfaces in same OSPF process

RTR-
TEST: If minimun values for BGP peer are correct
BFD_routing: Whetehr is default dicated by whether virtual supports it


Need to check what did with allow, dney and default and update info in variabel file
-Do all take them? Did I used deny?


Add to notes about removing dict elements if doen exist (use pop rahter than del)

Nice to have
1.  Add playbook for netbox
2. Add EOS, thin kcan use this to get the config

NXOS caveats
route-map RM_OSPF98>>BGP65001 permit 10`
  match ip address prefix-list PL_OSPF98>>BGP65001_ME50`
cant take prefix list containing '>'

Error: CLI DN creation failed substituting values. Path sys/rpm/rtmap-[RM_OSPF98

ADD TO LIST?DICT NOTES
POP dictionary - use when want to delte a key, but may not exist (similart to how used get() and setdefault())


If specified key is present in the dictionary, it remove and return its value.
If the specified key is not present, it throws an error KeyError.

TO get round this use this. If the key is is not present, the specified value (None) value is returned.
intf.pop('name', None)

To delete multiple dicts in one line:
del grp['switch'], grp['peer'], grp['tenant']
