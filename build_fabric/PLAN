-Interfaces - need to chaneg trunks to lists if more than 1 -  must be a list or integrar !!!!!!
INTERFACES: need to be able to create loopbacks



BFD_routing: Whetehr is default dicated by whether virtual supports it



Add to notes about removing dict elements if doen exist (use pop rahter than del)

NXOS caveats
route-map RM_OSPF98>>BGP65001 permit 10`
  match ip address prefix-list PL_OSPF98>>BGP65001_ME50`
cant take prefix list containing '>'

Error: CLI DN creation failed substituting values. Path sys/rpm/rtmap-[RM_OSPF98

POP dictionary - use when want to delte a key, but may not exist (similart to how used get() and setdefault())


If specified key is present in the dictionary, it remove and return its value.
If the specified key is not present, it throws an error KeyError.

TO get round this use this. If the key is is not present, the specified value (None) value is returned.
intf.pop('name', None)
